## **Question 1:**  

*Describe the architecture of a typical Flask application.*  


<hr>  

## **Question 2:**  

*Identify a database management system (DBMS) commonly used in web applications (including Flask) and discuss the pros and cons of this database.*

## **Question 3:**  

*Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology.*  

In general, the agile project management approach outlines a set values and principles upon which specific agile project management methodologies are based. These values include placing more importance on:
- People and communication rather than processes;
- Properly functioning software over documentation;
- Customer focused behaviour rather than contractual requirements; and
- adapting to change over a strict plan.

More specifically, the agile approach to project management is iterative and involves regular releases of the software product being developed, with customer feedback integrated into each release. The agile approach can be grouped into two broad project management methodologies, scrum and kanban (Atlassian, 2022). The most notable difference between the two approaches is that scrum uses fixed length iterations of work called sprints to address each item in a prioritised list of tasks, while kanban is focused more on getting things done as quickly as possible and bases the work iterations on team capacity (Atlassian, 2022). Regardless of which agile method is used, implementation will follow the same general process 

**1. Project planning:** this is where the following is determined:
- The end goal,   
- The value of the product to the organisation or client
- How the product will be developed. 
- A general project scope can be developed here, but it needs to remain flexible.

**2. Product creation roadmap:** At this stage a list of features that will make up the end product is developed. This list of features will be added to a backlog or to-do list. At a later stage each feature in the backlog will be built by the team as part of each sprint.

**3. Release planning:** In contrast to the waterfall project management approach, where there is one final release date, the agile method involves product features being released at the end of shorter development cycles (aka sprints). At the release planning stage a high level feature release plan is developed; however, since agile is flexible, this plan is subject to change and the release dates are reassessed at the beginning of each sprint.  

**4. Sprint planning:** This takes place before each sprint and involves meeting to determine resource allocation, how tasks will be achieved and task load distribution. A visual outline of workflow during the sprint is required to ensure the team is able to identify and remove any potential roadblocks.  

**5. Daily stand-ups:** short (max. 15 minute) meeting are held daily throughout each sprint. They involve each team member briefly discussing what they achieved the day prior and what they intend to achieve that day. 

**6. Sprint review and retrospective:** This stage involves holding two meetings:  
-  *Sprint review* - This involves meeting with the product stakeholders to show them the finished feature. This meeting is designed to ensure constant communication with the stakeholders, to build the relationship and ensure any product issues are dealt with early.  
- *Sprint retrospective* - This involves meeting with team members to discuss what went well and what could have been done better during the sprint. It is also important to discuss if the task load was too heavy or light and to highlight what was accomplished.
