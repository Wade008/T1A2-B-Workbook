*Discuss the implementation of Agile project management methodology.*  

In general, the agile project management approach outlines a set values and principles upon which specific agile project management methodologies are based. These values include placing more importance on:
- People and communication rather than processes;
- Properly functioning software over documentation;
- Customer focused behaviour rather than contractual requirements; and
- adapting to change over a strict plan.

More specifically, the agile approach to project management is iterative and involves regular releases of the software product being developed, with customer feedback integrated into each release. The agile approach can be grouped into two broad project management methodologies, scrum and kanban (Atlassian, 2022). 

Briefly describe each methodology 
- Scrum, backlog, sprint, fixed length, ceremonies within each sprint  

- Kanban, to do column (prioritised), work in progress limits (predefined) - matched to team's capacity. Can react to change very quickly, faster than scrum. Continuous release... focus on getting things done quickly...
